# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

Repo for the submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course.

## Overview
This project serves to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent
analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)


## Project Summary
This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.
The R script, `run_analysis.R`, does the following:

1. Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
2. Load the activity and feature info.
3. Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which
   reflect a mean or standard deviation.
4. Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those
   columns with the dataset.
5. Merges the two datasets.
6. Converts the `activity` and `subject` columns into factors.
7. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each
   variable for each subject and activity pair.

The end result is shown in the file `data_cleaning_project_results.txt`. A summary of the operations performed in
`run_analysis.R` can be found in the [Code book](CodeBook.md).
